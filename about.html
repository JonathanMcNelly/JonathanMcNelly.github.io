    I have previously been described as a vibrant character - but as this is a poor description for anything but a rainbow, I choose instead to consider myself confident, creative, and communicative. I have settled into the South East of England after a childhood in Germany and hope to see as much of the world as I can in the years to come. Culture, Story telling and the human condition are my greatest fascinations in life and I love to connect with any of these things. So have a look around, make yourself at home, and tell me about yourself and your new awesome project.

        <h2> A Freelance History</h2>
            
            <p> ...that is, just like human existence, a meek example of passage of time. Nonetheless, here are a few people I have worked with in my short life thus far.</p>
            
            <p> Sustainability Connections</p>
            <p> This small social enterprise focuses on bringing energy into the hands of ordinary people and tries to defeat fuel-poverty. For this just cause, I have redesigned their website and provided some illustrations. The final website can be viewed <a target="_blank" href="http://sustainabilityconnections.co.uk"> Here.</a> </p>
            
            <p> Worldwide Fruit Ltd</p>
            <p> In a team of four, I helped to deliver a 3D ethical animation displaying the pitfalls of modern day slavery. I was the storyboard, texture and concept Artist for the project. </p>

        <h3> Education </h3>
            
            <p> University of Kent, 2014-2017, Digital Arts</p>
            
            <p> For the last few years, I have studied Digital Arts at the University of Kent. The course modules included graphic and web design and also featured photography, game design, programming and 3D animation. I also productively used my time there to join Improv theatre. I also learnt to function in a team by completing so many lovely, multi-media group projects, and formed a valueable network of digital creatives. Groupwork isn't so bad, is it? </p>
            
            <p> Court Grammar School, Broadstairs </p>
            
            <p> When I first came to England on an exchange program, I joined this lovely language-focused grammar school and didn't learn any new languages. I did my A-Levels in English Literature, Psychology in Maths and, in the spirit of inconsistency, completed an AS-Level in Art and an AS-Level in Drama! I also did vague things like public speaking and piano practising and improved my English at the cost of forgetting my German.</p>
