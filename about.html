        <p> 
            Nathalie Kranich, that's me, is a Digital Artist based in the South-East of the UK. Life is hard as a starving artist, but passion and economic home cooking keep me alive. I am absolutely thrilled to have reached a stage where I am proud of my skills in Illustration and Design, and would love to bring my skills to the people. So hit me up and tell me about your awesome new project! You can find out a little more about me, my qualifications and odd little talents here, or skip straight ahead to:

        <h2> A Freelance History</h2>
            
            <p> ...that is, just like human existence, a meek example of passage of time. Nonetheless, here are a few people I have worked with in my short life thus far.</p>
            
            <p> Sustainability Connections</p>
            <p> This small social enterprise focuses on bringing energy into the hands of ordinary people and tries to defeat fuel-poverty. For this just cause, I have redesigned their website and provided some illustrations. The final website can be viewed <a target="_blank" href="http://sustainabilityconnections.co.uk"> Here.</a> </p>
            
            <p> Worldwide Fruit Ltd</p>
            <p> In a team of four, I helped to deliver a 3D ethical animation displaying the pitfalls of modern day slavery. I was the storyboard, texture and concept Artist for the project. </p>

        <h3> Education </h3>
            
            <p> University of Kent, 2014-2017, Digital Arts</p>
            
            <p> For the last few years, I have studied Digital Arts at the University of Kent. The course modules included graphic and web design and also featured photography, game design, programming and 3D animation. I also productively used my time there to join Improv theatre. I also learnt to function in a team by completing so many lovely, multi-media group projects, and formed a valueable network of digital creatives. Groupwork isn't so bad, is it? </p>
            
            <p> Court Grammar School, Broadstairs </p>
            
            <p> When I first came to England on an exchange program, I joined this lovely language-focused grammar school and didn't learn any new languages. I did my A-Levels in English Literature, Psychology in Maths and, in the spirit of inconsistency, completed an AS-Level in Art and an AS-Level in Drama! I also did vague things like public speaking and piano practising and improved my English at the cost of forgetting my German.</p>
